to shop for our wedding cake ü•ÇüçæüéÇ
the tim met with us to get to know us, what we were looking for?
what we liked?
disliked?
must haves?
then he sat us down, gave us each a glass of water & choices to try different types of cake, filling and frosting combinations of what his bakery offers.
this was not just paperwork and some notes like at grocery stores do. for us it was a great experience  that was fun and worth it for any couple who wants a cake they can call their own.
tim's knowledge of; what can and cannot be done ‚úÖ with your cake or pastry choices, the environment your choice will be in, amount needed to accommodate your event and decoration if needed i.e. wedding topper, colors, depends on the event.
we met april who would be making our cake.
our experience was so wonderful we invited him to the wedding if he would like to attend.

thanks to the tim and his staff who were involved with our cake, it was exactly like the combination we created but better because it was the final product. pictures to come soon."

update 11/20/20 and 1/3/21.

i test drove several cars and found only one that was very interesting. it was a 2011 hyundai sonata limited 2.0 turbo. the salesman john balin helped us. i took the car for a pre-purchase mechanical inspection at essex automotive. they found it a very good car. upon my return from the inspection to the dealership my timing was unfortunate. i entered the parking lot and one of the employees backed into me and damaged the car. this did not dissuade me from purchasing the car so i went inside and made the deal. of course the dealership covered all cost and repairs for the damage to the car. they even provided me with a service rental car at no charge while the car was being inspected repaired and the body work completed.

one of the bad things about the deal was that the finance officer ended up not telling the truth about the warranty on the car. there was a warranty sticker on the window of the car when i drove it for the test drive. he insisted it was an as-is purchase and that the warranty sticker was a mistake. as a previous car salesman in california i knew this was not true. even though this was an outstanding dealership you need to be careful with any finance officer who will sell you anything for an outrageous profit. the extended warranty price was $1,600 on a car that was already covered.

subsequently to the purchase i had a opportunity to visit the sister store burlington hyundai and they took care of me service wise. this is where i found out there was a lifetime warranty on the engine and the drivetrain.

i put the car through its paces and found that everything on the car was working and was very pleased with the quality and power of the car.

on january 3rd 2021, i was driving home from a day trip and while driving through a blinding snow storm i had a dangerous situation. the snow plow ahead of me drifted from the left lane over to the right lane without warning. i braked heavily and the abs brakes worked fantastically.  there was no slip or slide. the winter tires on the car worked great i was able to stop the car and avoid rear ending the plow truck within 25 yards, amazing."
